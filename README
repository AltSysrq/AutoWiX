AutoWiX is a preprocessor for WiX input files which simplifies the creation of
installers with large numbers of files.

An AutoWiX input file (extension .awxs) is a normal WiX input file, but with
some macro-like structures handled by AutoWiX. The following functionality
exists:

+ Any XML attribute whose value matches the format "autowix:guid:%s" is replaced
  by a GUID identified by %s. GUIDs generated by different runs of AutoWiX but
  with the same persistence file will be consistent.

+ The XML element of the form
  <autowixfilecomponents idbase="%s" base="%s" from="%s" />
  will result in a number of single-file components, one for each file
  encountered in a recursive traversal starting from the given root under the
  base directory. Directory elements are created as needed to replicate the
  directory structure (base is not included in this, only from). The ID for each
  file has the form "IDBASE.file.PATH" and for each component,
  "IDBASE.comp.PATH". Similarly, directories use "IDBASE.dir.PATH". The GUIDs
  for each item will be consistent if the same persistence file is used. All
  paths start with an backslash, and include base. idbase and base are both
  optional. When converting paths to IDs, backslashes are changed to
  underscores, and illegal characters are converted to "_.#._", where "#" is
  the base-10 representation of the character. If a generated ID does not start
  with a letter, an 'X' is implicitly prepended.

+ The XML element <autowixcomponentrefs /> will produce ComponentRefs referring
  to every Component generated automatically.

Since GUIDs must be consistent, AutoWiX stores information about them in a file
named PROJECT.awxg, where PROJECT is the base name of the input file. The
contents of this file is not defined, but it is textual. Since this file
essentially holds the identity of the installed program itself, IT IS IMPERATIVE
THAT IT BE KEPT, despite being autogenerated. It is recommended that it be
checked into source control along with the project (.awxs) file.
